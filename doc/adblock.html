      Disable AdBlock Plus on the <a href="../index.html">nano ᴊᴀᴍᴍᴇʀ</a> page. AdBlock
      prevents nano from showing your captured GIFs and minified source code, which AdBlock
      mistakenly thinks are popup ads.

      This is
      a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43283454/open-blob-objecturl-in-chrome">known
      problem</a> with AdBlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no ads or trackers on the nano ᴊᴀᴍᴍᴇʀ site, except for the cookies served by
      Google which are required to persist your cartridges to Google Drive.
