                  **Fantasy Console Specification**
            **by [Casual Effects](https://casual-effects.com)**

The
[**<span style="font-size:118%">nano</span> <span style="font-size:90%">JAMMER</span>**](../index.html)
is a fantasy console for tiny games with a single page of source code. It is perfect for
tweetjams and hobby coding on a busy schedule. Features:

- 64x64 pixel screen
- 32 colors
- 60 fps
- 96 built-in sprites
- 32 built-in sound effects
- Six-button gamepad
- External 2nd gamepad for multiplayer

The nano programming language is based on mathematics notation and looks just like
pseudocode. It is terse and context-sensitive, with indentation and newlines signifying blocks
and ends of statements.

For hassle-free hacking, nano comes with an integrated development environment that is free,
runs in a browser, and connects to Google Drive. So, you can turn a few spare minutes on any
device into productive coding time.

Beware that nano is intended as a challenge instead of a "reasonable" development platform.
The built-in restrictions are severe to limit the scope of your projects.  As a hobby project
itself, the compiler and documentation are minimalist.  We're talking old-school and no
hand-holding here. You must learn from examples, experiment, and cheerfully recover from
cryptic failures.

Examples
=============================================================================================

Space Dash
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Space Dash* is a complete game in 270 characters (277 by Twitter's Unicode weighting--still
less than one tweet!) once comments and blank lines are removed. The player flies a space ship
through enemy fighters to reach their home planet. It has a loading screen, background
animation, controls, collision detection, and end-game scene.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
#nanojam SPACE DASH
if(¬τ)x=32
// Game-over explosion
if(τ<0)pal(8+3ξ);circ(x,50,99+τ,19);cont

srand(5)
x=mid(9,x+2joy.x,54)
for u≤64
 // Stars
 s=3ξ;pset(u,(2⁸ξ+τs)%2⁸,5+s)
 // Enemy ships
 k=⌊2ξ+1⌋;v=τk-3⁸ξ;draw(5+14k,u,v,324,4);if(|x-u|+|v-50|<6)τ=-99

// End planet
circ(32,τ-9³,28)

// Player ship
draw(3,x,50,641)

// Victory screen
if(τ≥9³)text("YOU WIN");wait;τ=0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're probably wondering where the main loop is. Every nano program is implicitly within an
infinite `for` loop with variable variable `τ` that starts at zero, a clear screen command, and
a page flip.

A program always begins with `#nanojam` and the title of the game, which is used for the automatic
title screen and the cartridge label.

The first real line of *Space Dash* initializes the `x` position of the player spaceship. The
second line of code is the game-over animation. Line 3 resets the random number generator `ξ`
every frame with `srand()` so that can treat "random numbers" as stable game-level data.

I see an opportunity to save two more characters in this program. Can you find it? Can you find
*more*? With the remaining room, maybe you could remove the end planet to recover enough
characters to add a third type of enemy, while staying in character limit of a single
tweet. Now you're thinking like a nano programmer.


Plasma
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Plasma* is a little graphics doodle instead of a game. It shows field of animated value
noise. The two loops iterate over each pixel, computing its value independently.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
#nanojam Plasma,1
for y<64
 for x<64
  ψ=y+τ;v=mid(noise(3,⅛²x,⅛²ψ,¼³τ)+½,0,1)
  pset(x,y,hsv(⅗v+½,(1-v)^⅗,v,x,ψ))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same setup is great for computing fractals and ray marching in 3D.

Saving
====================================================================================

You can download your program to a text file by pressing the export button on the top of the
code editor (it looks like an arrow pointing down into a bucket).

Clicking on the "url" link at the bottom of the code editor opens a browser window with a URL
that encodes your program. Copying that URL allows you to give links that directly load nano
with your program in it. The code is in the URL itself--this does not save anything on the
server.

You can also export a minimized version of your code by clicking on the hyperlinked "chars" at
the bottom of the editor. This is useful when exporting to Twitter if you need the minimizer to
hit satisfy the Twitter weighted character quota.

A future release will support cartridges stored on Google drive, eliminating the need for a
local file system.


Emulator
====================================================================================

The emulator accepts keyboard and game controller input, as well as directly pressing its
buttons on screen for mobile. On a gamepad, you must press a button before directional input
will register in a web browser.

Player 1
: Directions: WASD or arrow keys
  <br> A button: Z or Space
  <br> B button: X or Enter 
  <br> start button: 1

Player 2 ("external gamepad")
: Directions: IJKL
  <br> A button: G or ;
  <br> B button: H or .
  <br> start button: 7

Pressing the "run" button on the editor automatically transfers keyboard focus to the emulator.

The emulator has special keyboard keys for:

- F6: screenshot
- F8: start/stop recording GIF


Numbers
=============================================================================================

Numbers are stored internally as double-precision (64-bit) IEEE floating point
values. Integer operators truncate the decimal places of their arguments. 

The first 2^53=9007199254740992 contiguous positive integers are exactly
representable. The largest finite representable number is about 1.7977x10^308. There are
about seventeen decimal digits of precision on arbitrary numbers. NaN and positive and
negative infinity are also exactly representable.

Numeric literals contain an optional single plus or minus sign and one of:

- a series of digits, followed by an optional decimal point and a series of digits
- a decimal point followed by a series of digits
- one of the following single-character fractions: `½⅓⅔¼¾⅕⅖⅗⅘⅙⅐⅛⅑⅒`

Examples of legal numeric literals:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
1
-21.4
0
-0
.0
0.5
-½
+72.41
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No hexadecimal, octal, binary, or exponential notation are allowed. Trailing decimal points
are not allowed.


Booleans
==========================================================================================

There are no literals for booleans. Comparison operations create booleans, but explicit
boolean values are never required because the logical operators work with any values.
For logical operators and flow control, `0`, `∅`, and empty string act as false.


Strings
==========================================================================================

String literals are enclosed in double quotes (`"..."`). They may not contain newlines or
double quotes. 

To enter a double quotation mark or slash, escape it with a slash: `"\\"` is the `\` character
and `"\""` is the `"` character.

The `+` operator performs string concatenation, coercing the right-hand argument if it is not a
string. String characters are read-only substrings accessed using zero-based array syntax.

The `.len` property of a string returns its length.


Arrays
==========================================================================================

Arrays are zero-based and have dynamically typed elements.  Array literals are surrounded in
square brackets and separated by commas. Square brackets are also used for l-value and r-value
dereference. Arrays also support the special indexing syntax described in the Subscripts
section.

The `len` property of an Array is its length. It is both readable and writable.

Array examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
a=[8,4,1]
a[0]="hello"
text(a[0],32,4)
text(a.len,32,12)
a₁+=2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Negative indices are permitted on arrays but will not be reported in the length. Reading an
out-of-bounds value from an Array returns `∅`.


Tables
==========================================================================================

Tables (also known as dictionaries and objects in other languages) map keys to values.
Literals are created using key-value pairs separated by a colon, surrounded by curly braces,
and delimited by commas. Table elements can be accessed using the string name of a property
in square brackets or by a period. This allows them to act as objects/structs.

Table examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
t={x:3,y:10}
t.x+=1
text(t["x"],4,4)
text(t.len,4,12)
text(t.keys[0],4,20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `keys` property of a table returns an Array of its keys. The read-only `len` property
of the Table directly gives the number of keys.


Variables
=============================================================================================

Variables are implicitly declared by their first assignment. Scopes are created only by
function definitions (specifically, loops and blocks do not create a scope the way that they do
in C++). Because user-defined functions are not supported in the current implementation, that
means all variables are global.

Variable name identifiers consist of an optional lower-case or upper case delta, plus 1-3
Roman letters or the unambiguous-looking Greek letters `αβδθλμξρσφψωΔΩ` by
themselves. The identifier must not be a reserved word. No numbers, underscores, or other
unicode characters are allowed in identifiers.

Examples of legal identifiers:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
col
scr
L
on
i
k
Δx
θ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Reserved
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are reserved tokens that cannot be used as variable names despite meeting the other
naming criteria:

`and`, `do`, `end`, `fcn`, `for`, `go`, `if`, `len`, `let`, `NaN`, `not`, `or`, `ret`, `to`,
`try`, `var`, `xor`, `new`, `get`, `in`, `has`, `set`

Built-in functions such as `cos` that are legal identifiers can be rebound. They are not
reserved.

The words below are not legal variable names anyway because they contain illegal characters 
or more than three letters, although the current compiler may not enforce that. They
are reserved. All JavaScript and C++ reserved words are also reserved in nano. 

`#`, `$`, `then`, `else`, `elif`, `begin`, `while`, `until`, `loop`, `?`, `:`, `break`, `cont`,
`flip`, `reset`, `main`, `catch`, `finally`, `enum`, `class`, `throw`, `return`, `yield`,
`await`, `auto`, `template`, `public`, `private`, `protected`, `const`, `static` `async`,
`goto`, `print`, `window`, `location`

Comments
==========================================================================================

Comments follow C/C++/Java/JavaScript syntax of `//` for single line comments and `/*`...`*/`
for multi-line comments. 

Because comments are the front line in the conflict between nano's goals of letting you write
*short* and *readable* programs, the editor shows the total character count with comments and
blank lines removed in the "min" section of the status bar at the bottom.


Operators
==========================================================================================

Symbol | Meaning
-------|-----------
`++`   | increment
`--`   | decrement
`=`    | assignment
`≟`    | equality test
`≠`    | inequality test (also logical XOR)
`+`    | addition and string concatenation
`-`    | negation
`+=`   | mutating addition, string concatenation
`-=`   | mutating subtraction
`<`    | less-than
`≤`    | less-than or equal to
`>`    | greater-than
`≥`    | greater-than or equal to
`∈`    | `for` loop container element-of
`^`    | exponentiation
`*`    | multiplication (see also implicit multiplication)
`*=`   | mutating multiplication
`/`    | floating-point division
`/=`   | mutating division
`%`    | remainder (modulo)
`%=`   | mutating modulo
`⌊⌋`   | floor function
`⌈⌉`   | ceiling function
`||`   | absolute value
`[]`   | table/array element or array constructor
`{}`   | table constructor (follow JavaScript syntax)
`.`    | table string-named element ("object member")
`()`   | grouping or function call
`∩`    | bitwise AND (bit set intersection)
`∪`    | bitwise OR (bit set union)
`&`    | logical AND
`or`   | logical OR (you can often use the shorter `∪`)
`⊕`    | bitwise XOR
`~`    | bitwise NOT
`¬`    | logical NOT
`◅`    | bit shift left
`▻`    | bit shift right

There is no conditional ("ternary ?:") operator in nano. 

Spaces are not required around operators in most cases, so long as the text parses
unambiguously. For example, `1or3` is equivalent to `1 or 3`.

Behaviour of these operators is consistent with the JavaScript definition of the operation
(even though JavaScript uses different operators). For example, the <b>logical</b>-AND expression 
`4 & 1` evaluates to `1` because `4` is non-false and the result of non-false AND another
value is the other value.


Exponents
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The characters `⁺⁻⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹ᵃᵝⁱʲˣᵏᵘⁿ⁽⁾` can form exponent expressions that operate as if
the `^` operator or `pow` function was invoked using those expressions as a second argument.
The entire exponent expression is implicitly surrounded in parentheses.

The variables `a`, `β`, `i`, `j`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `u` may appear only as single-character
variable names in exponents.

Exponentiation, including via exponent characters, may not be performed on a negative number
without parentheses. This follows the rules from JavaScript's `**` operator. For example,
`x=y-1²` is legal, but `x=y+-1²` is illegal and must be rewritten as `x=y+(-1)²` or (the
confusing and redundant expression, if that's really what was intended) `x=y+-(1²)`.


Subscripts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The characters `₊₋₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉ₐᵦᵢⱼₓₖᵤₙ₍₎` can form subscript expressions that operate as if
the array/table element accessor was invoked using those expressions as the second
argument.  For example, `aᵢ₊₂` is equivalent to `a[i+2]`. The entire subscript expression
is implicitly surrounded in parentheses.

The variables `a`, `β`, `i`, `j`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `u` may appear only as single-character
variable names in subscripts.


Implicit Multiplication
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplication is implicit wherever a number is immediately followed by a parenthesized
expression or variable (including a function call). This also ocurs when any exponent
appears immediately preceeding a parenthesized expression or variable. For example,
`2x`, `x²y`, `3(x+y)`.

Implicit multiplication can be used within subscripts or exponents.


Built-in Objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are special zero-argument operators for special functions and constants. They are
not variable names and thus cannot be redefined.

Name   | Value
-------|-----------
`ε`    | `0.0001`
`π`    | `3.141592653589793115997963468544185161590576171875`
`∞`    | infinity
`NaN`  | floating-point "not-a-number" value
`∅`    | nil ("undefined")
`pad`  | array gamepad of tables 
`joy`  | shorthand for `pad₀`
`ξ`    | random number on [0, 1), resampled every time the expression is used

Each gamepad table has direction fields `x` and `y` on [-1, 1] and `a` and `b` buttons on [0, 1] for current state.
It also indicates which directions and buttons were pressed *in the current frame* with 
`xx`, `yy`, `aa`, and `bb`, which have the same ranges as their current-state counterparts.

The main-loop variable `τ` is time, as integer number of frames. It may be reassigned 
to reset time.


Flow Control
==============================================================================================

The flow control statements are:

- `if` conditional with optional `else` and `elif` clauses
- `while` loop
- `until` loop
- `for` loop
- `loop` infinite loop
- `break` and `cont` within loops
- `reset` to restart the game

There is no switch, do loop, goto, try/catch, or other flow control.

Whitespace is significant, as in Python. Indentation must be exactly a single space per nested
block.

For flow control purposes, the empty string, 0, and `∅` are false.  All other objects
(including empty data structures) are true.

The entire program is implicitly wrapped in an infinite loop. This loop:

- flips the buffer
- clears the screen to colour `clr` (set `clr=∅` to avoid clearing the screen)
- increments `τ`

Explicitly setting `τ=0` within the main loop resets the game on the next loop iteration. 
There is no way to reset the game on the first iteration.

Within any loop, `cont` skips to the next iteration of the loop and `break` exits the loop.

Because the entire program has an implicit time loop surrounding it, executing `cont` at the
top level outside of any explicit loop will skip to the next `τ` loop iteration.  `break` at
top level will restart the entire program at `τ=0` with the default palette and clear color.

Multi-line `if` statements may be followed by `else` and `elif` clauses. These must always be
multi-line.

Numeric `for` loops increment by 1 each iteration and always count up. The loop variable must
be on the left-side of a single comparison loop expression or the center of a multi-comparison
expression.

Container iteration `for` loops iterate over the keys of a table, the characters of a string,
or the elements of an array _as of the beginning of the loop_. If the container is modified
during iteration, the original is still used. The Java/C++ equivalents of nano `for`-loop conditions
are:

nano              | Java/C++
------------------|------------------------
`for i≤k`         | `for (i = 0; i <= k; ++i)`
`for i&lt;k`      | `for (i = 0; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for 4≤i&lt;k`    | `for (i = 4; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for 4&lt;i&lt;k` | `for (i = 5; i &lt; k; ++i)`
`for x∈S`         | `for (x : S)`

The comparison operators in a `for` loop declaration are an overloaded syntax for comparison
operators (just as many languages overload the `=` operator for `for` loops).  They have
the lowest precedence. For example, `for i&lt;a||b` is equivalent to `for i&lt;(a||b)`.
To use regular comparison operators within `for` loop preamble, you *must* use parentheses to
make the parsing unambiguous, for example, `for i&lt;(a&lt;b)`.

Single-line `for`, `if`, `while`, and `until` are permitted. In each case, the test must be
enclosed in parentheses and the body runs to the end of the line. There can be multiple
single-line expressions on the same line. No `else` is permitted with single-line `if`.



Special
---------------------------------------------------------

The following are unconditional statements:

- `flip`: Flip the buffers and update `pad`. Does not clear the screen.
- `wait`: Flip the buffers and update `pad` until a gamepad button (not direction) is pressed.


They are not functions and cannot be bound to variables or invoked with parentheses.



Standard Library
=========================================================

Standard library functions are first-class values. They can be stored in data structures and
variables. There is no way to create new user functions in nano.

Array
---------------------------------------------------------
`array.add(x)`
: Append `x` to the array. O(1) expected amortized time.

`array.del(i)`
: Delete element `i` from the array, preserving order. O(n) expected time.

`array.find(x,i)`
: Find the index of the element whose value is `x`, starting at optional index `i` (default 0).
  Returns `∅` if not found. O(n)

`array.kill(i)`
: Delete element `i` from the array, swapping it with the last element. O(1) expected amortized time.

`array.len`
: Set or get the length of the array. O(1) time to read, O(n) amortized time to write.

`array.rem(x)`
: Delete the first instance of `x` in the array, maintaining order. O(n) time in the length of the array.

`array.sort(k)`
: Sort the array from least to greatest. If `k` is a string, then elements of the array are
  assumed to be objects and are sorted by that key. If `k` is a number, then elements of the
  array are assumed to be other arrays and are sorted by that index. If `k` is not specified
  and the array contains objects, then elements are sorted by their alphabetically-first
  key. If `k` is not specified and the array contains numbers or strings, then they are sorted
  by natural order.


String
---------------------------------------------------------
`string.find(x,i)`
: Find the index of the substring whose value is `x`, starting at optional index `i` (default 0).
  Returns `∅` if not found. O(n) time.

`string.len`
: Get the length of the string. O(1) time.

`string.sub(s,e)`
: Return the substring between `s` (inclusive) and optional `e` (exclusive, defaults to length).


Table
---------------------------------------------------------
`table.del(k)`
: Remove a key-value pair by key.

`table.keys`
: An Array of the keys.

`table.len`
: The length of the table (read only).


Math
---------------------------------------------------------
`abs(x)`
: Absolute value

`acos(x)`
: Inverse cosine in radians

`atan(y, x)`
: Arctangent of y/x, in radians

`asin(x)`
: Inverse sine in radians

`cos(x)`
: Cosine, `x` in radians 

`hash(x,y)`
: A hash value of string or number `x`, returning a value on [0, 1].
  If `y` is specified, the hash considers the union of the values.

`min(a,b,...)`
: Smallest of the arguments

`max(a,b,...)`
: Largest of the arguments

`mid(a,b,c)`
: Middle argument once sorted. Can be used for clamping.

`noise(octaves,x,y,z)`
: Value noise on the range [-1, 1], bicubically interpolated between integer locations at
  octave 0. Unused dimensions default to zero.

`pow(a,b)`
: Exponent. See also the `^` operator.

`rnd()`
: Random number. See also the `ξ` operator.

`sgn(x)`
: Sign of `x`.

`sqrt(x)`
: Square root.

`sin(x)`
: Sine of `x` radians.

`srand(seed)`
: Reset the random number generator, using an optional seed.

`tan(x)`
: Tangent of `x` radians.

<!--
Memory
---------------------------------------------------------
`get(i)`
: Read from memory address `i`.

`put(i, b)`
: Write byte `b` to memory address `i`.

-->

Graphics
---------------------------------------------------------

`cls(c)`
: Clear the screen to colour `c`. Unlike all other rendering commands, 
  requires a colour argument and does not set the current colour to `c`.

`circ(Ax,Ay,r,colourmap)`
: Draw a circle centered at (`Ax`, `Ay`) with radius `r`.

`draw(s,x,y,colourmap,xform,rot)`
: Draw sprite with index `s` centered at (`x`, `y`), remapping sprite colours by 4-digit
  `colourmap` and transforming by `xform`. See the Sprites section for more information.
  The result is undefined and may change between versions for the cases where `s` is less than
  zero or greater than 63.

`gray(v,x,y)`
: Same as `rgb(v,v,v,x,y)`

`hsv(h,s,v,x,y)`
: Return the colour closest to the hue-saturate-value specification, which are each on [0, 1].
  If `x` and `y` are specified, apply a dithering pattern based on the pixel position.

`pget(x,y)`
: Get the screen colour of pixel (`x`, `y`). Returns `∅` if out of bounds.

`line(Ax,Ay,Bx,By,colourmap)`
: Draw a line from (`Ax`, `Ay`) to (`Bx`, `By`) using the 1-digit colourmap.

`pal(p)`
: Sets the draw palette colours 1-6 from the 12-digit palette. See the Colours section for details.
  With no arguments, resets to the default palette.

`pset(x,y,c)`
: Set the colour of pixel (`x`, `y`) to colour `c` (*not* a colourmap). If `c` is not
  specified, use the previous colour.

`pset(c)`
: Set the previous colour to `c` (*not* a colourmap) and draw a single pixel offscreen. 

`rect(Ax,Ay,Bx,By,colourmap)`
: Draw the rectangle from any two points. The 2-digit `colourmap` is the fill and the border.

`rgb(r,g,b,x,y)`
: Return the colour closest to (`r`,`g`,`b`), which are each on [0, 1].
  If `x` and `y` are specified, apply a dithering pattern based on the pixel position.

`text(s,x,y,colourmap)`
: Print string `s` centered at (`x`, `y`) using the 2-digit colourmap. The first digit (1's place) is
  the text colour, the second digit (10's place) is the shadow colour, and the third digit (100's place)
  is the outline colour. The second digit is handled differently for other commands. 0 means transparent 
  instead of "previous colour" so that single-digit colourmaps render text with no outline or shadow.
  If only `s` is provided, defaults to drawing in the center of the top of the screen in the previous color.

`tri(Ax,Ay,Bx,By,Cx,Cy,colourmap)`
: Draw the triangle using the 2-digit colourmap for fill and border.

The default colourmap is 0, which corresponds to the colour from the previous command.

Borders are drawn inside shape coordinate boundaries and on top of fills, so a transparent 
border is identical to a border that is the same colour as the fill. Shapes include their
endpoints and borders.

Pixel centers are at integer locations. That is, pixel (0,0) covers (-½, -½) to (½, ½).

### Colours

The nano can display 32 different *colours*. The first 16 colours follow the order of the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) colours by 
Joseph White, but are shifted slightly towards [DawnBringer's DB16](http://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795) and tweaked
to give a better grayscale. The second 16 colours fill some holes between them and add the original Gameboy palette.

 ![<center>The nano Palette Tool</center>](palette-tool.png width=50%)


The *palette* is a set of 10 colours available for drawing shapes and sprites, which are
selected from the full 32 possible colours on the screen. In the palette, six colours are
user-selectable and four are special values that are not configurable.

The `pal` command changes configurable part of the palette by specifying a 12-digit integer.
Every two digits are one colour. Changing the palette does not affect colours already
written to the screen.

A *colourmap* is a mapping from parts of a shape or sprite to colours in the palette.
These are used for specifying the borders and fill colours (as a two-digit integer) of a 
shape, the colour of a line (as a one-digit integer), and remapping the four colours 
from a sprite (as a 1-4 digit integer).

The interpretation of colour map digits within the palette is:

- 0 = default colour for this command
- 1-6 = configurable
- 7 & 8 = reserved for future features
- 9 = transparent

For example, to set the configurable colours to a grayscale ramp (0,1,5,13,6,7) of PICO-8
colours, use `pal(70613050100)`. Note that there cannot be a leading zero on the number.

The default colour for most commands is the previous colour used. For text, the default is the
previous colour for the main stroke and transparent for the outline and shadow.

The initial configurable palette is equivalent to `pal(121008000607)`. This corresponds to
white, gray, black, red, yellow, aqua. The initial default colour is white. Changing the
palette preserves the default colour.

Note that unlike other drawing commands, `pset` and `pget` operate directly on colours instead
of palette values.

### Sprites

There are 96 hard-coded 8x8 sprites provided in read-only memory:

  ![<center>The nano Spritesheet</center>](../sprites.png width=512 border=2 style="image-rendering: pixelated; image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges; -ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor;")

They are designed so that the colourmap for `draw()` allows animation and re-use of individual
sprites as multiple images. For example, the heart sprite can be shown as an outline, half
full, completely full, or full and small by changing the colourmap.

`draw` renders centered sprites. Centering for an 8x8 sprite means offsetting x,y by 3.5 in each dimension. This makes 
(3,3) the "center" for integer coordinates.

The xform value is encoded in three bits as:
  - if `(xform ∩ 1)`, flip diagonally
  - if `(xform ∩ 2)`, flip horizontally
  - if `(xform ∩ 4)`, flip vertically
    
This allows all axis-aligned transformations to be encoded in a single digit. The 90-degree
clockwise rotations are thus (xor these with with 2 or 4 if you want to also flip H or V):

 CW Rotation |VHD Bits| `xform`
 -----------:|--------|---------
 0 degrees   | 000    | 0
 90 degrees  | 011    | 3
 180 degrees | 110    | 6
 270 degrees | 101    | 5

The `rot` argument rotates an arbitrary amount clockwise in radians *after* the `xform`
transformation. It defaults to zero.

For rotating by 0 &leq; `i` &lt; 4 integer 90-degree clockwise intervals programmatically,
consider these three different methods:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JavaScript
draw(s,x,y,c,0,½πi)

draw(s,x,y,c,3i-4⌊⅓i⌋)

r=[0,3,6,5]
draw(s,x,y,c,rᵢ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first approach has the advantage that it works for all (reasonably small) integer values of
`i`, including negative ones.




Sound
---------------------------------------------------------

`sfx(s)`
: Play sound effect `s`


Title Flags
---------------------------------------------------------

The first line of a nano program must be `#nanojam` followed by the game title and an optional
comma and integer flags. The only current flags are `1` = no title screen and `0` = default.
Future flags will affect the rendering of the title screen and cartridge label.


Implementation
====================================================================================

The current implementation compiles the nano source code to JavaScript for execution, and
passes through many JavaScript expressions even if not defined by the nano specification.

JavaScript features not explicitly mentioned in this specification are illegal. They might
sneak past the current version of the compiler, but are likely to break in future versions
or as the surrounding code changes.


Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following functionality is documented, but not implemented in the current Beta build. It
is scheduled for upcoming releases:

- `for` loops with explicit lower bounds
- Sound effects
- Google Drive support for cartridges
- Title screen animations
- Filled triangles
- Text shadow and outline

When converting values to strings, the `∞` value becomes the string `"Infinity"` and the `∅` value
becomes `"undefined"`.

<!-- Nano cannot execute `flip` or `wait` from within a function because of the way that threading
is handled in the implementation. Technically, user-defined functions aren't supported yet, so
this is not actually a limitation. -->
